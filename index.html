          <h4> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.
          </h4>
          <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

I was encouraged to enroll by a formestudent of theirs who can only say wonderful thingabout the program. The entire curriculum and stafdid not disappoint. They were very hands-on and never had to wait long for assistance. The agilteam project, in particular, was outstanding. Itook my learning to the next level in a way that ntutorial could ever have.
